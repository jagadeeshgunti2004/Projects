Differential count also shows normal ranges for neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, and basophils.\n",

A titer of 1:160 suggests a past or current infection, though it needs to be interpreted in context with other findings.  The reference range (1:20) shows this value is significantly higher.\n",

            "* **S. Paratyphi \"AH\" 1:20:** Antibodies against the \"AH\" antigen of *Salmonella Paratyphi* (another typhoid-causing bacteria).  This result is within the normal range, suggesting no current infection.\n",
